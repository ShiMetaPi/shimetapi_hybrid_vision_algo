# Hybrid Vision Algo (HVAlgo) - High-Performance Event Vision Algorithm Library

**Chinese** | [English](README_EN.md)

## Introduction

HVAlgo is a high-performance algorithm library designed by ShiMetaPi for event cameras (Event Camera), providing various advanced event denoising, computer vision, and image restoration algorithms. The library is built based on the ShiMetaPi Hybird Vision SDK and supports real-time event stream processing, making it suitable for applications such as robotic vision, autonomous driving, and high-speed motion analysis.

The ShiMetaPi Hybrid Vision SDK consists of two independent SDKs, hybrid\_vision\_toolkit and hybrid\_vision\_algo, which respectively implement the interface control and algorithm processing of the visual fusion camera.

## **`shimetapi_Hybrid_vision_algo `**

* **Location:** This is the core algorithm processing layer of the SDK, located in the middle layer of the architecture (the yellow part).
* **Core Function:** Focuses on processing raw data streams from the event camera, executing advanced computer vision algorithms to enhance data quality, extract useful information, or perform 3D understanding.
* **Included modules:**
  * **Noise Reduction (`Denoise`):** Removes noise from the event stream to improve signal quality.
  * **Interpolation (`Interpolation`):** Used to generate intermediate data points between events, or for spatiotemporal alignment/fusion with standard frame images.
  * **Restoration (`Restoration`):** Used for handling missing or anomalous data.
  * **Computer Vision/3D Vision (`CV/CV3D`):** Includes algorithms for event camera-specific or fused applications, such as object detection, tracking, 3D reconstruction, pose estimation, etc.
  * **Samples/data (`Samples/data`):** Provides sample code, models, or necessary datasets.
  * **External Dependencies (`external`):** By integrating third-party libraries, it provides users with more device options, such as: Shimetapi Hybrid vision toolkit\`, OpenEb (installed via command) and others.
* **Function:** It provides processed, enhanced, or interpreted event data information to upper-layer applications (`APP`). Application developers primarily call the interfaces of this layer to implement advanced functionalities of event cameras (such as playback, recording, analysis).

## **`shimetapi_Hybrid_vision_toolkit`**

* **Positioning:** This is the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) and the basic utilities layer of the SDK, located below the algorithm layer (deep blue section).
* **Core Functions:** It provides functionalities for interacting with hardware and basic data flow operations. It is responsible for reading raw data from physical interfaces, performing preliminary processing (such as encoding/decoding), and passing the data to the upper-layer algorithm layer. It also receives control commands from the upper layer to manage hardware.
* **Key Modules/Functions Included:**
  * **Read** (`Read`): Obtain the original event data stream from hardware interfaces (such as USB).
  * **Write** (`Write`): Used to send processed data or control commands back to the hardware (if supported).
  * **Setting** (`Setting`): Configure camera parameters (such as resolution, sensitivity, etc.).
  * **Decoder** (`Decoder`): If the event data is transmitted in a specific encoded format, it is responsible for decoding it into a processable format.
  * **Encoder (`Encoder`):** Used to encode processed data or recorded streams into a specific format.
* **Function:** It abstracts the details of the underlying hardware, providing a unified and relatively hardware-agnostic interface for the upper algorithm layer (`shimetapi_Hybrid_vision_algo`) to access and control the event camera data stream. It handles low-level communication protocols, data transportation, and basic format conversion.

## **Summary of the relationship and collaboration between the two:**

1. **`shimetapi_Hybrid_vision_toolkit :`**
   * Directly interacts with the hardware and the underlying system SDK.
   * Responsible for acquiring raw data (`Read`), performing basic format conversion (`Decoder`), controlling hardware (`Setting`), and outputting data (`Write`, `Encoder`), etc.
   * Provides a standardized data access interface to the upper layer (`algo` layer).
2. **`shimetapi_Hybrid_vision_algo :`**
   * Built on top of the `toolkit` layer.
   * Receives standardized event data streams from the `toolkit` layer.
   * Utilizes its advanced algorithm modules (such as `Denoise`, `Interpolation`, `CV/CV3D`, etc.) to process, enhance, analyze, and understand the data.
   * Delivers processed, more valuable information to the topmost application layer (`APP`) for use (such as displaying `UI`, `Player` playback, `Recorder` recording, `Analyzer` analysis).
   * Compatible with interfaces from different manufacturers (currently supports ShiMetaPi HV Toolkit and Openeb).
